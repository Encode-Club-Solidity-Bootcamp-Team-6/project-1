# Project for Week 1

The task was to create 'HelloWorld.sol' which stores a `text` and the `owner` address.

We interacted with the contract and passed ownership around. And created failing transactions when not being the owner.

This can be seen in the exported Etherscan CSV file in this repo.
Or on Etherscan directly, [here](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xb6596a464a6115a674bf836390b63e7061ad40b8).
