# Project for Week 1

The task was to create 'HelloWorld.sol' which stores a `text` and the `owner` address.

We interacted with the contract and passed ownership around. And created failing transactions when not being the owner.

This can be seen in the exported Etherscan [CSV file](https://github.com/Encode-Club-Solidity-Bootcamp-Team-6/project-1/blob/main/explorer-0xb6596a464a6115a674bf836390b63e7061ad40b8.csv) in this repo.
Or on Etherscan directly, [here](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xb6596a464a6115a674bf836390b63e7061ad40b8).
